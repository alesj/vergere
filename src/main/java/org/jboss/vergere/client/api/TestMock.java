/**
 * Specifies the annotated bean is a replacement type for all matching common subtypes in the context of a unit test.
 * <p>
 * When running unit tests with Errai IOC managed applications, beans which have been annotated with <tt>@TestMock</tt>
 * will be given injection consideration preference over any other matching beans.
 * <p>
 * For the purposes of beans annotated with <tt>@TestMock</tt>, the bean is treated as an otherwise normal bean, with
 * normal resolution rules, including the use of qualifiers.
