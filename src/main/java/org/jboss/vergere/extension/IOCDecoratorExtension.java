/**
 * A code decorator extension for the Errai IOC framework. Decorators allow the generation of code in and around
 * annotated bean elements.
 * <p>
 * For example, it may be desirable to register the instance of a newly created bean with a specific API as part
 * of the bootstrapping code. A decorator makes this possible by making the IOC container's code generator reach
 * out to a registered decorator associated with the specified annotation and providing the decorator an opportunity
 * to return it's own generated code associated wth the instance value.
 * <p>
 * Decorators can be registered for any element type (classes, methods, constructors, fields, and parameters). And
 * the type of element is automatically inferred by the element types which the registered annotation apply to.
 * <p>
 * Errai's own built in support for facilities such as <tt>@Service</tt> and <tt>@Observes</tt> implement
 * their functionality as decorators.
